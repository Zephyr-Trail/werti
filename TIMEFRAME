This is supposed to be (all in all) a generous time frame. I do not want to deliver the parts at those dates, but plan
on finishing them earlier to have a time buffer that can be used up for possible interfereneces not accounted for in 
this schedule.

May

8th: Official start of project. Infrastructure established. -done
- 9th:  initiate uima-tomcat glue, unifying logging and easing the debugging process. -done
- 11th: Document retrieval from from web sources (Reuters, Wikipedia), converting into CAS with uima. - first done, second not.
	basic web interface during alpha status (essentially a search box and parameter settings) -done
- 14th: writing annotators and CAS consumers that are able to operate on web-provided content, annotate it with
	basic, but non-destructive html-structure on the basis of primitive (e.g. regex) principles and return and 
	display the web page in its original form with annotations.
- 20th: implementing the linguistic backend (possibly, this might take longer). Including: tokenizer, PoS tagger.
- 23rd: Augmenting UIMA annotation methods with this linguistic structure providing applications
- 30th: Using JSP and the Google Web Toolkit (that can take Java Classes and turn them into platform-aware JavaScript)
	to extend the CAS annotators and consumers so that they provide interactive feedback to the user. Original WERTi 
	functionality should be achieved at this point (modulo the original interface).
June

- 2nd:  Web interface design (using GWT).
- 5th:  Web interface design will go wrong the first time, I'm sure. Here's where it's supposed to be actually finished.
- 6th:  At this point in time, WERTi should be cloned.

until I'm told to hand in: see TODO -> Wishlist and: provide documentation (annotate code (sadly, by hand, not with CAS) and
provide JavaDoc as well as writing of the report and preparing the presentation)
... and, of course. Testing.
