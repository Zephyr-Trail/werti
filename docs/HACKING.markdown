# Hacking WERTi

This document tells you how to modify WERTi.

## The File Hierarchy

	werti/
		desc/
		docs/
		metadata/

## The UIMA Descriptor Files

All UIMA descriptor files are located in `desc/`, which has the following
layout:

	desc/
		annotators/
		enhancers/
		operators/
		testers/
		WERTiTypeSystem.xml

The type system, which is global for all WERTi descriptors, is contained in
`WERTiTypeSystem.xml`.

All annotation on web content is performed by the descriptors in `annotators`.
This includes the two sub-categories `taggers` and `relevance`, for tagging and
relevance annotations respectively.

Different client side enhancement anchors are set up using the files in
`enhancers`.

`operators` contains aggregate descriptors to coordinate the work flow between
all other components.

Finally, `testers` are miscellaneous files used for testing. Feel free to add
your own.

## Documentation

The paper documenting the initial work on WERTi can be found in `docs/paper`.
Installation instructions and a readme are in the toplevel directory.

Javadocs and a complete API can be generated by calling the following command:

	mvn javadoc:javadoc
