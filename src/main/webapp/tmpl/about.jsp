	<h2>About WERTi</h2> 
	<p>
		WERTi is a web platform for second
		language learners and programmers interested in providing
		functionality for second language learning assistance. It is
		capable of retrieving documents from certain web sites and then
		annotating their linguistic structure in a way that could to
		help the learner. The web content can then be marked up in a
		modular way and the enhanced content exposed to the user
		through an interactive interface. This should ultimately allow
		the learner to understand the underlying principles of the
		target language, and thus acquire a firmer grasp of the
		language itself.</p>
