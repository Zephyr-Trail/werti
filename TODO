*** Severe

 * NullPointerException when klicking on Reuter's 'next page'

*** Important

 * React smart on encountering html-entities
 * Improve tagger:
   - demonize
   - test mulit-language stuff

*** Bugs
 * Don't screw up on html tags with &lt; and &gt; entities instead of < and >.
 * WERTi.java does not respect this.server; line 179
 * does the HTML annotation really need the tag-name field?

*** Wishlist
************

- put the lingpipe sentence boundary detector to use 
  (we'd have to re-implement its API for this)
- implement HTML parser [0]
- Implement TreeTagger
- Use HTML entities in sentence boundary followers (like, for " or
  similar)
- Internationalize the exceptions, logging, whole application following
  [1]
- Interactive Passivator
- Make up a RadioGroup for GWT
