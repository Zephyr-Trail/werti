*** Severe

 * Fix encoding problem with Net.fetch()
 * NullPointerException when klicking on Reuter's 'next page'
 * Connection still seems flaky for some reason or another.

*** Important

 * React smart on encountering html-entities
 * Improve tagger:
   - demonize

*** Bugs
 * Don't screw up on html tags with &lt; and &gt; entities instead of < and >.
 * maybe use the "surpress escaping" feature of the PTBtagger
 * does the HTML annotation really need the tag-name field?

*** Showstoppers
 * Update README

*** Wishlist
************
- Implement another Tokenizer
- put a DocumentAnnotation somewhere in the preamble that 
  would hold <script>s for the enhancements to use
- Use HTML entities in sentence boundary followers
- Interactive Passivator
- Scoring mechanism (this site helped me a lot-like)
- Rank search results accordingly
- Internationalize the exceptions, logging, whole application following [1]
~ Train the Stanford tagger on something that's not the Penn bank and see if it does better.
