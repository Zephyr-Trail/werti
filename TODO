*** Severe

 * NullPointerException when klicking on Reuter's 'next page'

*** Important

 * React smart on encountering html-entities
 * Improve tagger:
   - demonize
   - test mulit-language stuff

*** Bugs
 * Don't screw up on html tags with &lt; and &gt; entities instead of < and >.
 * does the HTML annotation really need the tag-name field?
 * WERTiContext doesn't work for the Stanford tagger. Probably the Stanford api
   needs a whole new reimplementation because it fucking blows.

*** Random
 * Make the tomcat logger log the time, too

*** Showstoppers
 * Update README

*** Wishlist
************

- put the lingpipe sentence boundary detector to use 
  (we'd have to re-implement its API for this)
- implement HTML parser [0]
- Use HTML entities in sentence boundary followers (like, for " or
  similar)
- get the CAS Visual Debugger to run with the new layout. This means that
  the HMMTagger should probably have a fallback if WERTiContext is not
  available.
- Internationalize the exceptions, logging, whole application following
  [1]
- Interactive Passivator
- Use md5 hashing for tempfiles instead of nanoseconds.
