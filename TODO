*** Severe

 * NullPointerException when klicking on Reuter's 'next page'
 * click on the words has a problem with almost all pages, but especially with [2]
 * non-termination bug in HTMLAnnotator with [5]

*** Important

 * React smart on encountering html-entities
 * <base> doesn't work on some sites [3][4]


*** Bugs
 * fib is put into anchors currently, which is awkward.
 * Don't screw up on html tags with &lt; and &gt; entities instead of < and >.

*** Showstoppers
 * Update README

*** Wishlist
************
- FIB: Focus next input when hitting enter and having a correct result
- implement HTML parser [0]
- Implement TreeTagger and lingpipe
- Use HTML entities in sentence boundary followers (like, for " or similar)
- Internationalize the exceptions, logging, whole application following [1]
- Interactive Passivator
