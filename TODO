*** Severe
 * Fix encoding problem with Net.fetch()
 * NullPointerException when klicking on Reuter's 'next page'
 * Connection still seems flaky for some reason or another.

*** Important
 * Fix regular expressions to not match so greedily (UIMA &| DOM)
 * Implement an Event interface so that callers of Dispatcher.process() know when it's ready

*** Wishlist
************
- handle org.werti.uima.Dispatcher(Config) more gracefully
- Interactive Passivator
- Scoring mechanism (this site helped me a lot-like)
- Rank search results accordingly
- Internationalize the exceptions, logging, whole application following
