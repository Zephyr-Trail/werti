*** Severe

 * Fix encoding problem with Net.fetch()
 * NullPointerException when klicking on Reuter's 'next page'
 * Connection still seems flaky for some reason or another.
^* Fix html tag recognition (will currently fail on JavaScript-code that uses the '<' or '>')

*** Important

 * Implement an Event interface so that callers of Dispatcher.process() know when it's ready
 * RelevantText should actually check for alnum ratio to weed out garbage.
 * fix HTML lib to mark comments
 * fix HTML lib to not react stupidly on <!--[if]><!endif> tags
 * Improve tagger:
   - demonize
^  - sentence boundary recognition

*** Showstoppers
 * Update README

*** Wishlist
