WERTi is supposed to be a tool for second language learners. It retrieves documents from certain web sites and then
annotates their linguistic structure in a way that is supposed to help the learner. This structure is then exposed
through an interactive interface which was designed to help the learner understand the underlying principles of the 
structures and, accordingly, the language itself.

The system currently only supports English as a target language, but is planned to be highly modular and thus extensible
towards other languages.

It runs is tested to run on a tomcat web server and relies on a recent JVM. It was only tested uisg the Sun JVM. The
basic architecture relies on tomcat's servlets API, the (incubating) Apache UIMA API and the Google Web Toolkit. Thus
it makes use of Java, JavaScript, HTML and XML peripheral (e.g. Ant, Eclipse EMF ...) technologies.
